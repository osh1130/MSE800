# Iris Dataset Analysis Project

This project demonstrates how to load, explore, and apply machine learning classification to the famous Iris dataset using Python.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `iris_loader.py`: Loads the dataset and show name of flowers
- `iris_analysis.py`: Performs exploratory data analysis and trains a classification model
- `main.py`: Runs the full pipeline from loading to classification

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the main program:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 📊 Output

- Prints name of flowers
- Shows pairplot visualization
- Outputs classification performance (accuracy and detailed report)
